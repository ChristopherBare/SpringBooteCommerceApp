### JPA

Java Persistence API is a collection of classes and methods to persistently store the vast amounts 
of data into a database. This tutorial provides you the basic understanding of Persistence (storing 
the copy of database object into temporary memory), and we will learn the understanding of JAVA 
Persistence API (JPA).

### Hibernate

Hibernate is an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) solution for JAVA. It is an open source persistent 
framework created by Gavin King in 2001. It is a powerful, high performance Object-Relational 
Persistence and Query service for any Java Application.

Hibernate maps Java classes to database tables and from Java data types to SQL data types and 
relieves the developer from 95% of common data persistence related programming tasks.

Hibernate sits between traditional Java objects and database server to handle all the works 
in persisting those objects based on the appropriate O/R mechanisms and patterns.

### Lombok

Project Lombok is a java library that automatically plugs into your editor and build tools, spicing up your java.
Never write another getter or equals method again, with one annotation your class has a fully featured builder, 
Automate your logging variables, and much more. 

Lombok essentially will use `@Data` to do everything for you. You can also use `@AllArgsConstructor` and `@NoArgsConstructor` to 
create all of the default constructors that you require without typing anything more than the annotations.
